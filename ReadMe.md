# Final Project Proposal


# Scientific Question(s):

Where is there evidence of a Younger Dryas event occurring in the Eastern United States? What is the extent/strength of the Younger Dryas event as we move south down the Eastern side of the US? Does the strength of a Younger Dryas signal in the pollen change as we move south? Or does the strength of the signal depend on the area/region?



# Dataset:

Overpeck, J.T.; Webb, R.S.; Webb, T. (1994-06-21): NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - Eastern North America 18,000 Year Vegetation Mapping. Using all subsets. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. https://doi.org/10.25921/820f-1785. Accessed 11/05/2024.



# Analysis Plan:
1. Go through all the data and separate into regions/areas of the Eastern US if they are not already. Make maps.
2. Compile a table of the main pollen types and their associated climates.
3. Compile pollen stratigraphies for each region, highlighting the Younger Dryas period.
4. Translate what the pollen data during the Younger Dryas period says about the climate in that region.
5. Make a conclusion about the strength of the Younger Dryas signal in each region and discuss what that means/what we can say about it.



# Outcomes I Would Like to Achieve:

Be able to contextualize the climate before, after and during the Younger Dryas period in all regions of the Eastern United States using pollen as a climate proxy. Be able to make a conclusion about if there is a stronger Younger Dryas signal (using pollen) in certain regions vs others, and see if there is a trend as we move south.
